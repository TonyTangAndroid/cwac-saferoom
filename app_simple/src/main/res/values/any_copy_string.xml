    <string name="security_hint_for_nerds">AnyCopy is an application that shows absolute respect to your data privacy and data security. As an Android software developer with three years experiences related in Android Privacy and Security research, I hate to tell you the astonishing fact that your privacy are at high risk to any application that you installed with {network_permission}. Why? Because Android System does not explicitly require permission to allow applications running on background nor to monitor your system Clipboard. This means that, as long as an App is granted to {network_permission}, which actually has already granted by default, even in Android 6.0, all data that you have ever copied, such as phone number, bank account, email and so on, could be possibly uploaded to third parties. This is an issue that should deserve more much attention than it should be. So here comes AnyCopy, an app that does not require any {network_permission}, which means that all your data will only be saved locally unless you manually upload your data into Google Drive, which means that you have absolute control of your data privacy. And given the security integrated in AnyCopy, you could be the only one in this world that could access your data in AnyCopy.</string>
    <string name="back_up_and_restore_detail">AnyCopy shows absolutely respect to your data privacy and data security. It does not require any {network_permission} at all, which makes sure that whatever copied in AnyCopy stays in AnyCopy. But it does not stop there. As I do understand that there are times when you wish you could back up your invaluable data into cloud server to make sure that you will never ever lose it. But how could this be achieved without {network_permission}? Here comes the beauty of AnyCopy which I take great proud of delivering it into your hand. It will fully utilizes the magic of Google Play service, which will be able to backup data in AnyCopy into your Google Drive account with encryption. And again, here comes another awesomeness of AnyCopy. Nobody, even Google, could possibly access the data that you have ever saved as it has been encrypted with AES-256-CBC algorithm. You are the only person in this universe that could access the data in AnyCopy and you are the only one who is responsible to preserve the data properly.</string>
